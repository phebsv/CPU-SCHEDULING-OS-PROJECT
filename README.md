# CPU-SCHEDULING-OS-PROJECT

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project aims to create a simulation tool that visually demonstrates how various CPU scheduling algorithms work. The simulation helps users understand the execution sequence of processes (displayed as a Gantt chart), their completion times, and computes key metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

**HOW TO RUN THE SIMULATION**

**SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS IN THIS PROJECT**

2. _Shortest Job First (SJF - Non-Preemptive)_ =
3. _Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF - Pre-emptive)_ =
4. _Round Robin (RR)_ =
5. _Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)_ =
